				Just wanted to make a quick about page. Not going to bother too much
				with formatting for the moment here. I'd rather put my time in the
				actual content.
			</div>

				My name's Nick, I'm a senior in college and love to play guitar. As a
				guitarist, I've struggled to find a tool to practice music theory
				specific to my use case. As such, I decided to create my own.
			</div>
			<div>
				You might notice some of the formatting isn't perfect, and if you try
				hard enough, I'm sure you can break it. I really made this as a tool for
				myself and figured why not just post this for others to benefit as well.
			</div>
			<div>
				It is still very much a work in progress, but if you enjoy it, please
				share it with other musicians. I hope it can help others as it has
				helped me.
